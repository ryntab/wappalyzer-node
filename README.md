  ## ðŸ§ª Wappalyzer Node Wrapper

This is a wrapper around the Wappalyzer library, with additional fetching methods and extended detection for technologies based on the Wappalyzer, WhatRuns and Snov.io

The project was inspired by a [wappalyzer-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wappalyzer-wrapper) which is no longer maintained.

## Installation & Basic Usage
#### Install the package
```
npm i @ryntab/wappalyzer-node
```

####  Import the scanner
```
import { scan, scanWithQueue } from  '@ryntab/wappalyzer-node';
```

#### Scan a site ðŸ”Ž
By default, the scanner method will be a basic fetch that parses the DOM and returns the matching technologies.
```
const  res  =  await  scan("https://fugamo.de/");
```
For a more in depth scan you can use set the scan target as `browser` to use Puppeteer with basic fetch as a fallback. Using Puppeteer will often more accurately return technologies.
```
const  res  =  await  scan("https://fugamo.de/", {
	target: 'browser'
	browser: {
		// Optional Puppeteer Config...
	}
});
```


You can also use the queued scanner to sequentially execute scans.
```
import { scanWithQueue } from  '@ryntab/wappalyzer-node';
const urls = [
	"https://fugamo.de/",
	"https://techcrunch.com/",
	"https://www.nytimes.com/
]

urls.forEach(async (url) => {
	const res = await scanWithQueue(url);
});
```
